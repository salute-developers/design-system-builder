## Current Priorities ðŸ”„

### High Priority

- [ ] **Authentication and Authorization System**
  - Add user accounts and login system
  - Role-based access control (Admin, Designer, Developer)
  - JWT token-based authentication
  - Protected routes and API endpoints

- [ ] **Design System Management**
  - Complete design system CRUD operations
  - Design system to component relationships
  - Export functionality for design systems
  - Import/export of design tokens

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Advanced API Features**
  - Add pagination for large datasets
  - Advanced filtering with multiple criteria
  - Bulk operations for components and variations
  - API versioning system

- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**
  - Add caching layer (Redis)
  - Optimize database queries with joins
  - Database connection pooling
  - Request compression middleware

- [ ] **Enhanced Documentation**
  - Seed database for local development 
  - API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
  - Interactive API explorer


- [] Shoud Empty fields should be NULL, instead of EMPTY STRING? it hapens while creating new tokens


### Low Priority
- [ ] **Monitoring & Production Readiness**
  - Structured logging system (Winston/Pino)
  - Performance monitoring (APM)
  - Error tracking (Sentry)
  - Health check endpoints
  - Metrics and analytics

- [ ] **Advanced Features**
  - Version control for design systems
  - Design token change history
  - Approval workflows for changes
  - Integration with design tools (Figma, Sketch)
  - Design system publishing/distribution

- [ ] **Security Enhancements**
  - Rate limiting by user/IP
  - CORS configuration refinement
  - Security headers middleware
  - Input validation schemas
  - Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Future Considerations ðŸš€

### Design System Publishing
- Generate platform-specific output files
- CI/CD integration for automated publishing
- NPM package generation for web tokens
- Mobile SDK generation

### Collaboration Features
- Team management and permissions
- Comments and feedback system
- Design review workflows
- Real-time collaboration features

### Enterprise Features
- Multi-tenant architecture
- SSO integration (SAML, OIDC)
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Custom branding and themes

## Technical Debt ðŸ”§

- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries in React
- [ ] Implement proper loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed API requests
- [ ] Optimize React re-renders with memoization
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Implement proper database transactions for complex operations

## Notes

The project has reached a solid foundation with:
- Stable database schema with proper relationships
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Modern UI with good UX patterns
- Well-structured API endpoints
- Proper development workflow

Next focus should be on authentication system and design system management features to make it production-ready.
