## Current Priorities ðŸ”„

### High Priority

- [ ] **Authentication and Authorization System**
  - Add user accounts and login system
  - Role-based access control (Admin, Designer, Developer)
  - JWT token-based authentication
  - Protected routes and API endpoints

- [ ] **Design System Management**
  - Complete design system CRUD operations
  - Design system to component relationships
  - Export functionality for design systems
  - Import/export of design tokens

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Advanced API Features**
  - Add pagination for large datasets
  - Advanced filtering with multiple criteria
  - Bulk operations for components and variations
  - API versioning system

- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**
  - Add caching layer (Redis)
  - Optimize database queries with joins
  - Database connection pooling
  - Request compression middleware

- [ ] **Data Quality Improvements**
  - Should empty fields be NULL instead of EMPTY STRING? (happens while creating new tokens)
  - Add proper data validation constraints
  - Implement data sanitization middleware

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Monitoring & Production Readiness**
  - Structured logging system (Winston/Pino)
  - Performance monitoring (APM)
  - Error tracking (Sentry)
  - Metrics and analytics

- [ ] **Advanced Features**
  - Version control for design systems
  - Design token change history
  - Approval workflows for changes
  - Integration with design tools (Figma, Sketch)
  - Design system publishing/distribution

- [ ] **Security Enhancements**
  - Rate limiting by user/IP
  - CORS configuration refinement
  - Security headers middleware
  - Input validation schemas
  - Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Future Considerations ðŸš€

### Design System Publishing
- Generate platform-specific output files
- CI/CD integration for automated publishing
- NPM package generation for web tokens
- Mobile SDK generation

### Collaboration Features
- Team management and permissions
- Comments and feedback system
- Design review workflows
- Real-time collaboration features

### Enterprise Features
- Multi-tenant architecture
- SSO integration (SAML, OIDC)
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Custom branding and themes

## Technical Debt ðŸ”§

- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries in React
- [ ] Implement proper loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed API requests
- [ ] Optimize React re-renders with memoization
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Implement proper database transactions for complex operations
- [ ] Fix Docker container dependency issues (occasional race conditions)
- [ ] Add automated testing for Docker containers

## Recently Completed (Latest Updates) ðŸŽ‰

### API Documentation & Tooling
- âœ… **Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0.3** - Complete API documentation with interactive testing
- âœ… **API Test Suite** - Automated validation script (`test-swagger.sh`)
- âœ… **CLI Integration** - `generate-ds` tool working with Docker backend

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- âœ… **Docker Multi-Environment** - Separate dev/prod configurations
- âœ… **Database Seeding Pipeline** - Automated migration â†’ seed â†’ seed-all workflow
- âœ… **Container Health Checks** - All services monitored with proper dependencies
- âœ… **Development Workflow** - Hot reloading, automated builds, comprehensive docs

### Documentation & Usability
- âœ… **Interactive API Docs** - Swagger UI with custom styling and examples
- âœ… **Setup Automation** - `setup-docker.sh` script for one-command deployment
- âœ… **Comprehensive Guides** - Docker setup, API usage, troubleshooting sections

## Notes

The project has reached a mature foundation with:
- âœ… **Stable database schema** with proper relationships and seeding
- âœ… **Comprehensive test coverage** with 42+ passing tests
- âœ… **Modern UI** with excellent UX patterns and real-time updates
- âœ… **Well-documented APIs** with interactive Swagger documentation
- âœ… **Production-ready Docker setup** with multi-environment support
- âœ… **CLI tooling** for external integration and component generation
